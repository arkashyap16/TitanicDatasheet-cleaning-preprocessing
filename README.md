ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
ðŸ“Œ Internship Task #1 â€” AI & ML
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning. The goal is to transform raw data into a usable form by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and removing outliers.

ðŸ§° Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The dataset includes information about Titanic passengers:

Demographics (age, sex, class)
Ticket info
Survival status
Port of embarkation
âœ… Steps Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Viewed dataset structure, null values, data types.
Missing Value Handling

Age: Filled with median
Embarked: Filled with mode
Cabin: Dropped due to excessive nulls
Categorical Encoding

Sex: Mapped (male â†’ 0, female â†’ 1)
Embarked: One-hot encoded
Feature Scaling

Age and Fare: Standardized using StandardScaler
Outlier Detection

Used IQR method to remove outliers from Fare
Saved Cleaned Dataset

Output: cleaned_titanic.csv
ðŸ“¦ Output Files
cleaned_titanic.csv: Final preprocessed data ready for modeling
data_cleaning_preprocessing.py: Python script with all steps
